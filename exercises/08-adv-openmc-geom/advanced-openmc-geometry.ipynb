    "## Part I: Full Geometry Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will develop a simple model of a realistic system.  The\n",
    "system represents an integral experiment for measuring neutron cross sections,\n",
    "in which an ion beam is directed at a target to produce neutrons in the center\n",
    "of a sphere of test material.  Rather than modeling the ion beam, we will make\n",
    "assumptions about the source and instead model a pure neutron beam. How\n",
    "convenient for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Beginning with the materials below, generate a model for the geometry desribed below\n",
    "\n",
    "    The model consists of a sphere of Be (radius, r=25 cm) with a 2 cm-radius hole\n",
    "    running from one side to the center. Centered in the sphere is a disc-shaped\n",
    "    tritium target (r=2 cm, thickness=0.5 cm). The Be sphere is embedded in a sphere\n",
    "    of concrete (r=40 cm) that also has a 2 cm-radius hole (aligned with the hole in\n",
    "    the Be sphere).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now modify the above model according to the following\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Using a `CompositeSurface`, replace the concrete sphere with a concrete\n",
    "    cube that has the same extents.\n",
    "    - Replace the cylindrical hole in the Be with a cone that opens from a\n",
    "    radius of 2 cm near the target to a radius of 4 cm at the outside of the Be\n",
    "    sphere (i.e., at r=25 cm). The hole should continue through the concrete as\n",
    "    a 4 cm radius cylinder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define any additional space that is left undefined inside the radius of the concrete sphere (r = 40cm).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Apply appropriate boundary conditions to the exterior surfaces of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Plot both the cells and materials with a plane that slices through center of the hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part II: Repeated Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will use a hexahedral lattice to generate a 10 x 10 x 1\n",
    "array of spheres. In this lattice, the spheres will alternate in both directions\n",
    "between a 1 cm radius sphere of Uranium-235 and a 0.5 cm radius sphere of boron,\n",
    "all spaced 4 cm apart. The spaces between the spheres is filled with water. The\n",
    "following steps will help you create this geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the following surfacces:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create surfaces for the two spheres (r=1 cm and r=0.5 cm). Both surfaces may be defined at the origin. The spheres will not overlap when they are used in the lattice.\n",
    "  - Create a surface (macrobody) [or surfaces (planes)] to define a single lattice element that surrounds the spheres\n",
    "  - Create a surface to define the outer boundary of the entire lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the following cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Create cells for each of the spheres and surrounding water (there should be two distinct water cells).\n",
    "  - Create universes for the uranium+water and boron+water cell combinations.\n",
    "  - Create the lattice as described above\n",
    "  - Create a cell with a region that bounds the entire lattice and fill it with the lattice. Apply an appropriate boundary condition to this cell.\n",
    "  - Create a universe that contains the lattice cell.\n",
    "  - Plot the final lattice colored by both cell and material.\n"
