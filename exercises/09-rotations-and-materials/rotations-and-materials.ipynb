    "\n",
    " - A sphere of Be (radius, r=25 cm) with a conical hole (r=2 cm near the target; r=4 cm at the surface of the sphere) from one side to the center.\n",
    " - A 0.5 cm-thick tritium disk (r=2 cm) embedded in the center of the sphere.\n",
    " - A cube of concrete surrounding the Be. The concrete should have a 4 cm-radius hole aligned with the hole in the Be.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now add a pair of diagnostic ports on to the existing geometry. These ports represent space to place detectors for measuring neutrons that are transmitted through the Be sphere. Use cell transformations to accomplish the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Add a cylindrical port (r=1 cm) that passes through the concrete to the surface of the sphere. The central axis should be at an angle of 60 degrees relative to the axis of the original beam port.\n",
    " - Add another diagnostic port, this time on the other side of the original beam port. The central axis should be at a 50 degree angle relative to axis of the original beam port.  This port should be defined by r=1 cm at the surface of the Be sphere, r=2 cm at the surface of the concrete, and r=1.2 cm at a point half-way between.\n",
